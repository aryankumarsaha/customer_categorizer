Customer Personality Segmentation
Problem Statement
This project aims to build a machine learning system that predicts customer personality segments. Itâ€™s useful for malls, stores, and product-based companies. By analyzing customers' personal and purchase data, we can group them into clusters and predict their segment using classification techniques.

Proposed Solution
To predict customer clusters dynamically, we use machine learning. First, we cluster customers based on existing data and domain knowledge. Then, we train models to predict which cluster a new customer belongs to, leveraging historical customer data.

Tech Stack Used
Python

FastAPI

Machine Learning algorithms

Docker

MongoDB

How to Run
Make sure you have a MongoDB Atlas account and have uploaded the shipping dataset.

Create and activate a conda environment:

bash
conda create --prefix venv python=3.7 -y  
conda activate venv/
Install dependencies:

bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
Set environment variables:

bash
export AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=<your_aws_access_key>  
export AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=<your_aws_secret_key>  
export AWS_DEFAULT_REGION=<your_aws_region>  
export MONGODB_URL=<your_mongodb_connection_string>
Run the app server:

bash
python app.py
Start training on: http://localhost:5000/train

Make predictions on: http://localhost:5000/predict

Run Locally with Docker
